# BOTsy
BOTsy is online store hosting a wide variety of products made by robots. In this app we will focus on reinforcing the major components of rails, model validation, authentication as well as introducing a world in which creative, self-driven, artificially intelligent robots make goods for human consumption.  This is a world without the need for sweatshops and industrial jobs. This is a world where no human is subjugated to the misery of factory work or menial labor. This is a world where robots and human coexist in harmony, bestowing enumerable benefits of convenience and quality of life. This is BOTsy.

## Submission Guidelines
Your final project must be deployed to [Heroku](http://heroku.com). Your team will open a single pull request for the entire project. Include the link to your Heroku deployment in the PR's description.

Your `README` file on your Github repo should contain a link to your live site.

## Team Leaders
Each team will have team leaders who are responsible for keeping track of each team member's contributions. Rotate leader roles at the beginning of each week; every team member should be in at least one leader role during the project.

- Stand Up Leader
  - Notifies team members about meeting schedule and ensures that everyone is present and ready
  - Takes notes about each person's daily report in Stand Up
  - Keeps the meeting moving
- Task Leader
  - Leads discussion on task assignment
    - Decide if a task should be completed alone or in a pair
    - Assign tasks based on...
      - Individual comfort
      - Desire
      - Ability
  - Ensures the task list stays up to date

## Stand Up Meetings
The Project Manager for your team will determine the timing for all Stand Up meetings. Because PMs are managing multiple projects at once this time will be different for each team, and may change from day to day. The meeting schedule will be communicated to the Stand Up Leader as soon as it is determined.

At the end of each day, your team's assigned Project Manager will review the Trello board for all tasks discussed during that day's Stand Up meeting.

## Weekly Demos
In a real world work environment, a team's success is measured by their product as opposed to each individual's contribution.

Each team will present their progress and respond to questions from their Project Manager each Friday. Every team member will participate in these demos; the PM will ask specific questions regarding 1) the team's progress and plan for completing the project, 2) the technical decisions and implementation, and 3) every team member's understanding of the underlying technical structures.
